# Granary App
This is a school project I worked on with a team of four members using C# and .NET framework.
We barely built the whole application as part of a web development class. After working on a few React projects,
I have decided to build the app using React and Firebase. In addition of the features we defined in class, I extended/added 
features. 

## What is Granary?
Granary is a social app built for farmers; a platform where farmers can share their common interests. With Granary, farmers
can also create groups or cooperatives and share ideas and data. They also have access to a real-time weather app. They 
can also create and track different records about their farms.

## Features
* User authentication (email + password, Google + Facebook auth)

* Firebase: 9.9.2
